Utility to give you a printable copy of your Trello Board, lists - cards - labels - desc - comments - votes. 

This is helpful even when you just want to be able to scan quickly, without having to turn each card over.

You may safely use this for private/proprietary data
as all processing is client side - you paste in the JSON exported from your Trello board
